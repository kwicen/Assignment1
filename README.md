The name of my application is kwicento-Count.

kwicento-Counter takes in a name from the user and creates an object of class Counter using it. It then will display all of the objects in this 
ArrayList in a ListView. These objects are clickable and take you to a screen where you can increment this counter, edit it, or delete it.
